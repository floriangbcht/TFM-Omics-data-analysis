# TFM-Omics-data-analysis
Hello World! My name is Florian and this repository contains all pieces of R code that I used for my TFM project (Master's in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya–Universitat de Barcelona).

This project aims at refining the classification of ER-low and intermediate-positive breast tumors by integrating ESR1 expression and immune-related features, starting from clustering analyses on the entire cohort and evaluating how alternative thresholds impact these specific subgroups. More specifically, the main goal can be divided into three specific objectives:
1.	To identify natural subgroups from ESR1 gene expression using clustering models.
2.	To characterize the immunological profiles based on deconvolution analysis and further compare the investigated classifications.
3.	To validate the hypothesized best classification scheme using supervised ML models.
